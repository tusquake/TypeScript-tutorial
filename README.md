# My TypeScript Project

This project demonstrates various TypeScript concepts and features, including primitive and non-primitive data types, advanced types, array methods, numerical systems, and TypeScript configuration.

---

## Topics Covered

### 1. **Primitive Data Types**
- `number`: Numeric values (decimal, octal, hexadecimal, binary).
- `string`: Textual data.
- `null`: Represents the intentional absence of a value.
- `undefined`: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
- `bigint`: Large integers beyond the safe range of the `number` type.
- `symbol`: Unique and immutable values.

### 2. **Non-Primitive Data Types**
- `object`: A collection of key-value pairs.
- `array`: A list of values.
- `tuple`: An array with fixed types and length.
- `enum`: A set of named constants.
- `function`: A block of reusable code.

### 3. **Advanced Types**
- `unknown`: A type-safe counterpart of `any` that requires type-checking before use.
- `void`: Represents the absence of a return value.
- `never`: Represents values that never occur (e.g., functions that throw errors).

### 4. **Array Methods**
- Filtering odd and even numbers.
- Mapping numbers to their squares and cubes.
- Reducing numbers to calculate sums.
- Sorting and reversing arrays.
- Finding unique and duplicate numbers.
- Using methods like `every`, `some`, `find`, and `findIndex`.

### 5. **Numerical Systems**
- Conversion between octal, hexadecimal, binary, and decimal systems.

### 6. **TypeScript Configuration**
- Setting up `tsconfig.json` to support modern JavaScript features.
- Configuring `target` and `lib` options for compatibility with ES2015+ features.
